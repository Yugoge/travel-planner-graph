# docs/ Index

Auto-generated folder inventory. Last updated: 2026-01-31

## Purpose

Documentation and workflow JSON storage for development and cleanup workflows.

## Structure

Total subdirectories: 2
Total files: 0 (workflow JSONs stored here during execution)

## Subdirectories

### clean/
- **Purpose**: Clean workflow JSON storage
- **Files**: Context JSONs, inspection reports, cleaner reports
- **Created by**: /clean command workflow
- **Content**: Temporary workflow data (may be empty between executions)

### dev/
- **Purpose**: Development workflow JSON storage
- **Files**: Context JSONs, dev reports, QA reports
- **Created by**: /dev command workflow
- **Content**: Temporary workflow data (may be empty between executions)

## File Types

- `.json`: Workflow context and reports
- Expected during workflow execution only
- May be empty when no active workflows

## Organization

**Pattern discovered**:
- Workflow-specific subdirectories (clean/, dev/)
- JSON files created during command execution
- Files are temporary (cleared between runs or archived)

**Typical contents during execution**:

**clean/ workflow**:
- `context-{id}.json` - Full workflow context
- `cleanliness-report-{id}.json` - Cleanliness inspection
- `style-report-{id}.json` - Style inspection
- `completion-{id}.md` - Final completion report

**dev/ workflow**:
- `context-{id}.json` - Development context
- `dev-report-{id}.json` - Implementation report
- `qa-report-{id}.json` - QA verification report
- `completion-{id}.md` - Final completion report

## Current State

**Status**: Empty (no active workflows)
**Last used**: Unknown (no files present)

**Note**: This is normal. Workflow JSONs are created on-demand during /clean or /dev command execution.
