    "original": "所有subagent只回复complete，进行文档操作，学习application-assistant中的generate工作流和subagent回复模式",
    "clarified": "Change travel-planner subagent communication pattern to match application-assistant generate workflow: (1) Subagents return ONLY 'complete' in normal operations, (2) All data passed via working files (data/*.json), (3) In refine scenarios, subagents return JSON with modified_data + changes diff, (4) Orchestrator verifies files with test -f before proceeding, (5) Never read file contents in agent responses - only pass file paths",
    "what": "Redesign /plan workflow subagent communication to use file-based pipeline with diff reporting",
    "why": "Current pattern has subagents returning verbose summaries directly to orchestrator. This creates coupling, makes orchestrator context-heavy, and prevents clean separation of concerns. File-based pattern (from application-assistant) enables: (1) Clear orchestrator/subagent boundaries, (2) Verifiable outputs, (3) Diff tracking for iterations, (4) Reduced context usage",

    "why_problematic": "Direct data return: (1) Couples orchestrator to agent response format, (2) Prevents clean file verification, (3) No diff tracking for iterations, (4) Verbose responses waste context, (5) Orchestrator can't independently verify working file updates",
