    "original": "现在开始重构我的plan步骤，我打算废弃html agent，直接在plan的最后使用一个脚本推送网页。现在我的计划是学习root/multi-asset-portfolioi的equity-research command。对于旅行中的每一个关键的要素都派遣相关的专业agent进行处理，主agent只是一个BA和orchestrator，等于说是把root/multi-asset-portfolioi的equity-research command和roo/knowledge-system中的ask合并。同时现在派出一个subagent先研究旅行计划一般如何写，如何在一页呈现，同时要包括全部要素（可以加入多级结构比如点击进入新的弹窗或者页面之类的，你可以参考budget-management的html设计）",
    "clarified": "Refactor /plan command to use multi-agent orchestration pattern from equity-research, where main agent is BA+orchestrator and specialized subagents handle each travel component.
