  "requirement": {
    "original": "1. Attraction Types图表还是错误，扇形图没有合并\n2. Budget Breakdown并没有展示出具体的侧边栏看板，也就是说没法看到详细的活动数据以及filter之后的类型\n3. mountain / observation deck / tourist attraction Attractions这是什么玩意？\n4. 四个综合数据栏应该具有展开的属性\n5. 你没有发现每一页都有重复的内容吗！！！\n6. Google map gaode map和小红书请使用logo而不是颜色，不然的话总之你想一个比较美观的方案\n7. timeline和cities页面长一模一样！",
    "clarified": "Fix 7 critical UI/UX issues: (1) Attraction Types pie chart still showing duplicate slices for same categories, (2) Budget Breakdown charts not opening drawer with detailed data and filter options, (3) Raw English category names like 'mountain/observation deck/tourist attraction' displayed instead of friendly Chinese labels, (4) Top 4 stats cards should be expandable/collapsible to show detailed breakdown, (5) Duplicate content appearing across multiple pages/tabs, (6) Map service links (Google/Gaode/RedNote) should use brand logos instead of just colored buttons, (7) Timeline and Cities tabs showing identical content instead of different views",
