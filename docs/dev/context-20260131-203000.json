  "timestamp": "2026-01-31T20:30:00Z",
  "requirement": {
    "original": "你不应该在之后让subagent搜索吗，这是什么系统性问题。同时在最后的refine阶段声名refine的时候一天一天地refine，而不是一次性全部丢给用户",
    "clarified": "Fix two systematic issues in /plan command workflow: (1) Orchestrator should NOT perform domain-specific searches (e.g., train schedules) during BA phase - delegate to specialist agents instead; (2) Refinement phase should be incremental day-by-day instead of presenting all warnings at once",
    "what": "Modify /plan command documentation to clarify orchestrator boundaries and implement day-by-day refinement UX",
    "why": "Current workflow violates separation of concerns (orchestrator doing specialist work) and creates poor UX (overwhelming users with all conflicts at once)",
    "where": [
      ".claude/commands/plan.md"
    ],
    "scope": {
      "included": [
        "Clarify Phase 1 orchestrator role: collect raw requirements only, NO domain research",
        "Add explicit prohibition against orchestrator doing WebSearch for specialist domains",
        "Redesign Phase 4 Step 12-13 for incremental day-by-day refinement",
        "Update Step 2 interview questions to note searches delegated to agents",
        "Add day-iteration loop in refinement phase"
      ],
      "excluded": [
        "Creating new validation scripts (may not be needed)",
        "Modifying existing specialist agent definitions",
        "Changing JSON schema structure",
        "Modifying HTML generation logic"
      ]
    },
    "success_criteria": [
      "Phase 1 explicitly states orchestrator does NOT perform WebSearch for domain research",
      "Step 2 interview collects raw requirements without searching train schedules, flights, etc.",
      "Phase 4 implements day-by-day refinement loop (Day 1 warnings → resolve → Day 2 warnings → resolve...)",
      "Refinement workflow allows skip/accept options per day",
      "Documentation clearly separates orchestrator responsibilities from specialist agent responsibilities"
    ],
    "constraints": [
      "Must maintain existing multi-agent architecture",
      "Cannot break existing validation scripts",
      "Must preserve JSON file structure for agent communication",
      "Keep command compatible with existing subagent definitions"
    ]
  },
  "root_cause_analysis": {
    "symptom": "User observed orchestrator performing train schedule searches during BA interview instead of delegating to transportation-agent",
    "root_cause": "plan.md documentation does not explicitly prohibit orchestrator from doing domain-specific WebSearch during Phase 1, leading to ambiguity about orchestrator vs specialist responsibilities",
    "root_cause_commit": "ccd5318 - refactor: Use dedicated subagents instead of general-purpose",
    "why_introduced": "Commit ccd5318 switched from general-purpose to specialized subagents (meals-agent, transportation-agent, etc.) but did not update Phase 1 documentation to clarify that orchestrator should NOT do the work these specialists are designed for",
    "why_problematic": "Violates Three-Party Architecture separation of concerns: orchestrator should coordinate/collect requirements, specialists should perform domain research. Current ambiguity allows orchestrator to overstep into specialist territory.",
    "timeline": "Introduced 2026-01-29 with subagent refactor, but orchestrator boundary was never explicitly documented",

      ".claude/commands/plan.md"
