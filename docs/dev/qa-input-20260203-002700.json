    "original": "html生成脚本出现了重大系统性缺陷，我不要你修复html，我要你修复脚本：\n1. budget全都是欧元单位但是人民币价格\n2. budget by city不可展开了，不好，我之前不是已经设计过展开了吗（自己参考我的root/budget-management中graph command的展开功能\n3. 统计图表还应该有活动数量per city、建议旅行天数per city，都可以展开成活动和每天行程\n3. 还应该有travel路线地图，思考如何使用你现有的技能将所有旅行计划可视化为地图\n4. attraction type彻底乱套，完全没有加总了，变成了单个单个显示\n5. cities panel价格同样显示错误，同时并不是每一个景点都加入了超链接，我要求每一个景点都加入，同时有的有中文有的没有中文，全部取消中文显示\n6. cities展示的应该和timeline有所区别，既然timeline已经有day多少了，cities就纯按照地理聚类了",
    "clarified": "Fix 6 systematic issues in HTML generation script (scripts/generate-travel-html.sh):\n1. Currency: Convert all CNY values to EUR (user wants EUR display everywhere)\n2. Budget by city: Add expandable/collapsible budget breakdown by city (reference: /root/budget-management asset-tracker.html expandable pattern)\n3. Statistics: Convert all stat cards to expandable format showing detailed breakdowns\n4. Travel route map: Create horizontal Kanban-style route visualization (cities horizontal, timeline vertical, click city to show details)\n5. Attraction aggregation: Group by type with counts, not individual listings\n6. Cities panel: Geographic clustering (not timeline order), add hyperlinks (Gaode/Google Maps + RedNote), remove all Chinese text",
