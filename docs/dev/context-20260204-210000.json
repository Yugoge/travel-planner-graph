  "requirement": {
    "original": "不应该是钦膳斋吗？我之前不是修复过了agent之间沟通中文转英文再转中文出现的误差问题吗？为什么又出现了",
    "clarified": "Chinese restaurant name '钦膳斋' (Qinshanzhai) was incorrectly written as '秦膳斋' in meals.json. This is the SAME bilingual annotation issue that was fixed before (dev-20260204-141257). User had previously fixed Chinese character corruption due to romanization homophones, but the issue recurred when orchestrator invoked meals-agent without proper bilingual annotation enforcement in the prompt.",
    "what": "Fix immediate issue (correct 秦膳斋 → 钦膳斋) AND prevent recurrence by strengthening orchestrator prompt enforcement",
    "why": "Bilingual annotation rules exist in plan.md but orchestrator didn't follow them when invoking meals-agent. Orchestrator's prompt only mentioned format ('Restaurant Name (原文)') without emphasizing CRITICAL importance or WHY (homophone prevention). This weak enforcement led to agent outputting incorrect Chinese characters.",

        "Document this as SECOND occurrence of same issue"

      "excluded": [

    },
    "why_introduced": "Orchestrator (me) invoked meals-agent without copying the full bilingual annotation requirement from plan.md. Assumed brief mention of format was sufficient, didn't include WHY or CRITICAL emphasis.",
    "why_problematic": "Without CRITICAL emphasis in prompt: (1) Agent doesn't prioritize accuracy of Chinese characters, (2) Agent might use auto-complete or fuzzy matching for restaurant names, (3) Homophones (钦 vs 秦) get confused, (4) Same issue recurs despite previous fix",
