This deleted method contained the correct cost conversion logic (ticket_price_eur → cost). The new _merge_day_data method only reads attr.get('cost', 0) which defaults to 0 when cost field doesn't exist. Agent data uses EUR-denominated fields (ticket_price_eur, price_per_night_eur, etc) but HTML generator expected CNY-denominated 'cost' field.",

Now correctly converts agent EUR fields to display CNY costs."

Both provide legitimate, high-quality images of actual attractions. User concern about 'wrong images' may stem from seeing generic Unsplash fallbacks for POIs without cached Gaode images, not from Gaode image quality issues.",
