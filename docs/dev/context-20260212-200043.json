  "requirement": {
    "original": "现在我们已经开发了load.py和save.py实现了对以上内容的全面替代。现在将这两个文件的调用方法加入到review和Plan中彻底替代刚刚的开发。但是在开发之前你需要先调查这两个类型的优劣",
    "clarified": "Replace the non-functional jq-based day data extraction in review.md (commit 481b4c8, lines 368-466) with tested load.py calls, and fill the critical extraction gap in plan.md line 681. Scope: load.py only (extraction focus), save.py deferred.",
    "what": "Integrate load.py into review.md and plan.md for day data extraction",
    "why": "jq-based approach in review.md has incorrect JSON paths (.timeline vs .data.days[].timeline) and fails on real data. Testing confirmed 100% failure rate. plan.md has same extraction gap at line 681 with no implementation.",
    "where": [
      ".claude/commands/review.md - Lines 368-466 (Step 14 INNER loop)",
      ".claude/commands/plan.md - Line 681 (Step 14 INNER loop)"
    ],
    "scope": {
      "included": [
        "Replace jq commands (lines 374-393) with load.py batch call in review.md",
        "Update validation (lines 436-466) to use load.py output in review.md",
        "Remove PROHIBITED section (lines 417-434) - jq-specific, no longer relevant",
        "Fill extraction gap at plan.md line 681 with load.py implementation",
        "Update root cause references to mention load.py as tested solution"
      ],
      "excluded": [
        "save.py integration (future work)",
        "Level 2 optimizations for informational queries",
        "Changes to load.py or save.py scripts themselves"
      ]
    },
    "success_criteria": [
      "review.md Step 14 uses load.py instead of jq",
      "plan.md Step 14 line 681 has explicit load.py extraction implementation",
      "No jq path errors (correct .data.days[] structure)",
      "Validation checkpoints use load.py output",
      "Documentation clearly explains load.py usage with examples",
      "Test with real data confirms drone show present (no truncation)"
    ],
    "constraints": [
      "Maintain same Step 1-2-3 structure in both files (minimal disruption)",
      "Preserve file-based pipeline architecture (orchestrator reads, subagents write)",
      "Keep integer-only step numbering",
      "No changes to subagent behavior or data file formats"

  "root_cause_analysis": {
    "symptom": "Drone show (20:30-21:00) omitted from Day 1 review, jq commands in review.md lines 374-393 would fail on execution",
    "root_cause": "Commit 481b4c8 added jq-based extraction to fix Read limit:100 bug, but used incorrect JSON paths. Testing revealed jq path '.timeline[$day - 1]' is wrong (should be '.data.days[$day - 1].timeline'). plan.md line 681 has same extraction gap with no implementation.",
    "root_cause_commit": "481b4c8 - fix: Add explicit extraction methodology to /review Step 14 (2026-02-12 19:17:55)",
    "why_introduced": "Quick fix to address data truncation without testing on real data structure. Assumed JSON structure based on documentation, not actual files.",
    "why_problematic": "Incorrect paths cause jq to fail with 'Expected JSON value' error. Would cause 100% failure rate on review.md execution. plan.md never had implementation, so AI would default to Read limit:100 (same original bug).",
    "timeline": "481b4c8 introduced broken jq paths on 2026-02-12 19:17:55. Detected via testing on 2026-02-12 19:45:00.",
