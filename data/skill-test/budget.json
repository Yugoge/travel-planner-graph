    "ACCOMMODATION (Save ¥800-1,000): Switch from 5-star Niccolo Chengdu (¥650/night) to mid-range options: 1) Orange Hotel Chunxi Road (¥200-250/night), 2) Hanting Hotel Taikoo Li (¥180-220/night), 3) 7 Days Inn Chunxi Road (¥150-180/night). This would reduce total cost to ¥3,020-3,220.",
    "MEALS Day 1 (Save ¥200-250): Replace dinner at upscale Shudaxia Hotpot (¥300) with mid-range options like Yulin Chuanchuan (¥100-120 for 2) or Xiaolongkan express location (¥150-180 for 2)",
    "MEALS Day 2 (Save ¥150-200): Replace Mingting Restaurant lunch (¥360) with equally authentic but cheaper options: 1) Chen Mapo Tofu original restaurant (¥150-180), 2) Local Sichuan restaurants near Panda Base (¥120-150)",
    "SHOPPING (Save ¥200-300): Reduce shopping budget by: 1) Skip expensive panda souvenirs at Panda Base gift shop, buy at local markets (save ¥80-100), 2) Reduce Day 3 final shopping from ¥150 to ¥50",
    "ENTERTAINMENT (Save ¥240): Skip optional Sichuan Opera show on Day 2 - this brings overage down from 42% to 34%",
    "TRANSPORTATION Day 2 (Save ¥50-80): Use Metro Line 3 to Panda Base (¥8-10 for 2 people) instead of taxi (¥50), though this adds 30-40 minutes travel time",
    "RECOMMENDED COMBINATION: Switch to mid-range hotel (save ¥800) + reduce meal costs (save ¥300) + skip opera (save ¥240) = Total savings ¥1,340, bringing trip to ¥2,680 (within budget)",
    "ALTERNATIVE BUDGET PLAN: Keep luxury hotel but drastically cut meals and shopping: 1) Cheaper restaurants (save ¥400), 2) Minimal shopping (save ¥300), 3) Skip opera (save ¥240), 4) Use public transport more (save ¥100) = Total savings ¥1,040, bringing trip to ¥2,980 (just under budget)"

Premium dining at ¥1,310 (44% of budget) also significantly over typical Chengdu costs. CRITICAL RECOMMENDATION: Switch to mid-range hotel (¥200-250/night) and moderate restaurant choices to bring total within ¥3,000 budget.
