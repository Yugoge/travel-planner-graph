## Conclusion

The budget agent successfully:
1. Calculated accurate daily and trip totals
2. Detected significant budget overage (34%)
3. Identified root causes (5-star hotel, premium dining)
4. Provided actionable recommendations with specific alternatives
5. Created optimized budget scenario meeting user's ¥3,000 constraint
6. Preserved core travel experiences while achieving savings

**Key Insight:** The main budget issue stems from a mismatch between the user's stated "mid-range" accommodation preference and the selected 5-star luxury hotel (¥650/night). Switching to actual mid-range hotels (¥200-250/night) alone would nearly solve the budget problem, demonstrating the budget agent's value in identifying such discrepancies.

**Agent Status:** `complete`
