  "notes": "Shopping is scheduled for specific days to avoid fatigue. Day 7 (Shanghai) focuses on niche boutiques and toy collectibles as requested. Days 15-16 (Beijing) cover fashion shopping and indie bookstores with English sections. Costs are estimated budget allocations in USD, not fixed prices. Most shops accept WeChat Pay and Alipay; cash less common. Anfu Road and Wukang Road in Shanghai are walkable and can be visited together. Sanlitun in Beijing is the best area for fashion and has nearby bookstores. Pop Mart and similar toy stores are located in malls throughout both cities. All bookstores mentioned have some English book sections, though selection varies. Shopping areas are integrated near other activities to minimize travel time. Note: Avoid shopping during lunch hours (12-2pm) as some smaller boutiques may close. Weekend crowds can be heavy at Nanluoguxiang and Sanlitun."
