    "Entertainment: Reduce from €494 to €200-250. Day 1 spa: switch from InterContinental (€101) to Golden Impression budget option (€63), saving €38. Day 14 photography: choose Himo Studio (€190) instead of Wave Soda (€303), saving €113. Day 8 show already booked at €0, no change needed.",

Skip paid museums on some days (Rockbund Art Museum €15, Museum of Art Pudong €15), focus on free attractions (The Bund, Tianzifang, Forbidden City area, hutongs, parks, bookstores). Consider skipping or reducing: Tianjin day trip (€20), some temple entrances (€6-10 each).",

Cook more meals at rental apartment (Days 9-21 in Beijing), choose cheaper lunch options (€8-12 instead of €15-25), skip some restaurant dinners in favor of home cooking. Specific savings: skip Da Dong (€40), reduce Michelin restaurant count, choose local restaurants over hotel restaurants.",

    "assessment": "The original €1,000 budget for 22 days (€45.45/day) is extremely tight for this itinerary, especially with shopping priorities. Even with aggressive cuts, realistic minimum is ~€900-1,000. The current plan at €2,597.74 is unrealistic. To meet budget, user must choose: (A) Shopping priority: cut entertainment and activities to fund €300-400 shopping, or (B) Experience priority: cut shopping to €50-100 to fund activities and entertainment, or (C) Ultra-budget mode: eliminate all non-essential spending (Scenario 3 above).",
    "recommendation": "Implement Scenario 2 (Moderate optimization) to meet €1,000 budget. This preserves essential experiences (photography at budget studio, key attractions, some shopping) while cutting luxury spending (designer boutiques, premium spa, paid museums). Requires cooking ~50% of meals and focusing on free attractions."
  },
  "notes": "Budget analysis completed. Current plan significantly exceeds €1,000 budget by €1,597.74 (159.77% overage). Primary overspending categories: Shopping (€950), Entertainment (€494), Activities (€406), Meals (€984). Transportation already well-optimized (€54.74). Accommodation is €0 (all pre-booked or free). Most realistic path to meet budget is Scenario 2 (Moderate optimization) which reduces shopping to €100, cuts entertainment luxury items, focuses on free attractions, and increases home cooking. This brings total to ~€903. Scenario 3 (Aggressive) brings total under €500 but eliminates most experiences. User must decide priorities: shopping vs experiences vs meeting budget constraint. Days 7, 20, 14, and 1 are the highest-cost days and offer greatest savings potential. Days 12-13 and 18-19 show that home cooking can reduce costs to €5-25 per day. Consider applying this model to more Beijing days (Days 15-16, 20-21) for additional savings. Currency conversion: 1 EUR = 7.88 CNY used for all calculations."
