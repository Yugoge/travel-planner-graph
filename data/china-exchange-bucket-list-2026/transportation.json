Alipay and WeChat Pay now accept international credit cards (Visa/Mastercard) with spending limits of $5,000/transaction and $50,000/year. Hong Kong and Macau require separate visa/permit - check with Tsinghua University international office before booking. For Hong Kong, Octopus Card is essential. For Macau, free casino shuttle buses are the best transportation option and open to everyone."
