  "notes": "Shopping budgets are estimates for souvenirs and local specialties per trip. Actual spending varies based on personal preferences. Tea purchases (especially Longjing in Hangzhou) can significantly increase budgets. Hong Kong shopping depends on cosmetics/electronics interests. Focus on compact, lightweight items due to luggage constraints across multiple trips. All prices in EUR based on approximate 2026 exchange rate of 1 EUR = 7.8 CNY. RedNote MCP skill was unavailable due to environment limitations - recommendations based on established knowledge of Chinese city specialties and Gaode Maps verification of shopping locations."
