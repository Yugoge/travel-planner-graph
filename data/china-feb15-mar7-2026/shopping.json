Avoided overwhelming shopping days - only 5 shopping days total across 21-day trip. Shanghai has most shopping (Days 5+7) as requested for fashion/clothing. Beijing options provided for multiple areas since rental apartment location TBD - Sanlitun (trendy central), Nanluoguxiang (historic), 798 (artsy), Zhongguancun (university district). All Popmart stores verified via Gaode Maps POI search. Cost estimates are budget allocations in USD, not fixed prices. Shopping areas are walkable and well-connected to metro. Tianzifang and 798 are particularly INFJ-suited with quiet, artistic, small-scale boutique atmosphere."
