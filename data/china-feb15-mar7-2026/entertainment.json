  "notes": "Entertainment planning complete with updated research from web search (Feb 2026). CRITICAL ACTION ITEMS: (1) 只此青绿 performance (Day 8): NOT CONFIRMED - 2026 schedule not yet released. Monitor www.chncpa.org starting Jan 2026. Feb 22 may not have show based on 2025 schedule (shows were Jan 30-Feb 4). Prepare backup plan. (2) Couple photography (Day 14): MUST BOOK 2-4 WEEKS ADVANCE via Xiaohongshu/Dianping. Wave Soda Studio recommended for artistic/themed shoots (2,388 RMB). (3) Dance studio (Day 10): Millennium Dance Complex Beijing in 798 Art District - best for English speakers, visit for registration + optional trial. (4) Chongqing spa (Day 1): Spicy Panda (观远足道) chain near Jiefangbei recommended - book after dinner via Meituan. All entertainment aligns with INFJ preferences (niche, fancy, small venues). Evening activities provided for weekdays respecting Tue/Wed/Thu constraints (no far day trips, but evening activities OK). Costs converted to EUR based on 1 EUR = 7.5 CNY exchange rate. Additional cafe/bookstore/toy store recommendations provided for girlfriend's interests (cute things, English books, trendy spots).",
