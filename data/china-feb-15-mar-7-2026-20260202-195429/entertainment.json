User can translate simple instructions ('fold here', 'press edges'). Activity naturally includes passive elders who can demonstrate traditional techniques. Duration: ~90-120 minutes. These dumplings will be eaten at midnight (守岁), creating connection between afternoon activity and midnight tradition.",

Family might comment on performances, girlfriend watches visual acts (dance, acrobatics, martial arts), user whispers brief translations if needed. Low-pressure: focus is on BEING TOGETHER, not performing or entertaining. Conversations about France, family, traditions happen naturally WITHOUT scheduling them. English subtitles available via CGTN YouTube livestream (https://www.youtube.com/@ChinaGlobalTVNetwork) or iQIYI International - set up laptop/tablet for girlfriend if desired.

  "notes": "DAY 2 (除夕) MAJOR RESTRUCTURE: Fixed unnatural forced schedule. 1) 包饺子 moved to AFTERNOON (13:00-15:00) - this is traditional timing, NOT evening. Dumplings made in afternoon are eaten at midnight. 2) DELETED forced 'scheduled conversation segments' ('photo viewing 21:30-22:00', 'comparing traditions 22:00-23:30') - these were criticized as unnatural. Conversations happen ORGANICALLY during dinner/春晚, NOT as timed activities. 3) 春晚 is BACKGROUND starting 20:00 during dinner, NOT a themed activity. English subtitles available via CGTN YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/@ChinaGlobalTVNetwork) or iQIYI International for girlfriend. 4) Evening flow (18:30-23:45) is natural: dinner, 春晚 in background, chatting naturally, tea/snacks, 守岁 at midnight with afternoon-made dumplings. This matches authentic Chinese family 除夕夜 traditions. CRITICAL BOOKINGS: 1) Dance drama '只此青绿' for Feb 22 (verify 2026 schedule, book 1-2 months advance via National Centre). 2) Couple photography Feb 27 (book Wave Soda/Himo Studio 2-3 weeks advance). 3) Day 1 Chongqing spa - VERIFIED via RedNote & Gaode Maps: Serene SPA highly recommended (67 likes, ~100 RMB). Book evening slots in advance."
