  "notes": "Budget analysis for Days 1-4 complete. Total costs calculated from meals.json, accommodation.json, attractions.json, entertainment.json, shopping.json, and transportation.json. User budget is €1,000 (~$1,086 USD) excluding purchased flights and shopping. Current trajectory shows significant budget overage primarily due to luxury choices on Day 1 (hotel + spa) and premium dining throughout. Days 2-3 family stays provide good cost savings. Shopping excluded from user's stated budget but included in analysis for comprehensive view. Major upcoming expenses Days 5-21 include Disneyland, theater tickets, photography session, and Beijing apartment rental. Recommendations focus on downgrading Day 1 luxury items and moderating restaurant choices to bring spending closer to budget target."
