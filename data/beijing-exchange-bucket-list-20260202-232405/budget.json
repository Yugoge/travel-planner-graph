  "notes": "Budget calculations completed for all 13 days across 7 trips. Exchange rate used: 7.8 CNY = 1 EUR (with 5% buffer). Key findings: (1) Trip 7 (Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Macau) significantly exceeds €500 budget due to Hong Kong/Macau premium pricing, especially accommodation (850 CNY/night) and entertainment (House of Dancing Water 898 MOP); (2) Days 8, 10, 13 are the most expensive single days; (3) Overall trip is under total budget of €3,500 (7 trips × €500) by €1,043.33; (4) Recommended to reallocate budget from under-budget trips or optimize Trip 7 as detailed in recommendations. Currency notes: Mainland China uses CNY, Hong Kong uses HKD (≈0.88 CNY), Macau uses MOP (≈0.93 CNY). All shopping budgets are estimates based on typical purchases at each location. Optional entertainment shows totaling 1,163 CNY (€149) not included in base calculations - user can add selectively. Local transportation within cities (metro/taxi estimated 20-50 CNY/day) not separately itemized but included in activity costs where relevant. Budget calculations cross-verified against timeline.json to ensure all meals, accommodations, attractions, entertainment, shopping, and transportation accounted for."
